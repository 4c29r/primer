# Phase 1 challenges
The first challenges of the Desmos Primer Program are divided into two levels: 

- [Level 1 - 20 points each](level-1.md)  
  These are the easiest challenges that do not require much effort and thus they are worth 20 points each. 
  
- [Level 2 - 50 points each](level-2.md)  
  A little more harder tasks that can be completed by spending a little more time, and thus they are worth 50 points each.
