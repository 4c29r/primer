# Desmos Primer Program

## Introduction
We at Forbole have always thought that decentralization and community participation are the most important things during the development of a new project. This is way we have thought about _Desmos Primer_, a simple cookbook that will help you start playing with Desmos learning step by step its functions. 

## How the primer works
To make things easy as possible, we will periodically publish new challenges that, once completed, will grant you `Desmos Points` (in short, `DT`). To allow even new users to get used to the blockchain world, along with each challenge we will publish the completion guide step-by-step, as well as some details to explain simply why specific operations are being done and what they do under the cover. 

Once the primer ends his effect, no new challenges will be published and all your earned Desmos Points will be converted into `Desmos Token` (`DT`), the official staking token of the Desmos Chain, based on a conversion scale that we will publish when ready. 

Please note that you can complete the challenges in any order you prefer, and any time you are more comfortable doing so, but doing so **after the program ends** will **not** grant you any Desmos Point.

## Registering to the primer
In order to take part to the primer challenged you **will not** be required to follow a KYC procedure. However, you will be required to have a GitHub account as it will be used in order to identify you uniquely. If you do not have one yet, you can register for free here: [Join GitHub](https://github.com/join).

## Phases
